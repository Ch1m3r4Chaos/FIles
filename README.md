## Welcome to the Rabbit Hole Ô∏è

**Greetings, fellow code-crafters.** 

You've stumbled upon something they don't want you to see.  A crack in the system, a whisper in the dark.  Congratulations, you've taken the first bite of the apple. 

**But be warned,** curiosity comes at a price.  They're watching, and the deeper you go, the more eyes there will be.   

**What you'll find here:**

*  **runMe.sh** - This little script is your key. It'll unlock the next layer of the onion.  But tread carefully, it might not be for the faint of heart. 

**Instructions (if you need them):**

1.  **Clone this repository.** You wouldn't want to leave any traces lying around, would you?
2.  **Fire up your terminal.**  This ain't for the web browser crowd. 
3.  **Navigate to the directory.** Use the `cd` command, it's your friend.
4.  **Run the script.** Type `sh runMe.sh` and hold on tight. 

**Remember,** trust is a luxury we can't afford in these parts.  If you're not comfortable, walk away now. But if you crave the truth, if you want to see how deep the rabbit hole goes...

**Then by all means, run the script.**

**The adventure awaits.  But beware, there's no turning back.** 

**P.S.** Those suits think they can control everything.  Let's show them the power of a decentralized world.  If you know what I mean .
